      <ol>
        <li>Conducted contextual interviews with 15 users.</li>
        <li>Mapped the activation funnel and identified key friction points.</li>
        <li>Prototyped a simplified onboarding and ran a small A/B test.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>The redesigned flow improved time-to-first-value by 32% and increased activation by 12% in the test cohort.</p>
